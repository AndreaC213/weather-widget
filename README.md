# **Weather Widge**

### **1. The Challenge**
The goal of this first part is to build a pixel-perfect weather widget using a publically available API.

Technology:
* React

Instructions:
* Download the design Sketch file: http://cloud.refersion.com/c15a5d94bcfb (or PDF).
* In the Sketch file, you’ll see the design along with a duplicate containing notes which detail the data that should be used from the API response. For example “name”, refers to this object.
* To get the current data, please use this API: 
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=10036,us&appid=00ab9760d6984c9b493982a245485892
* The API also provides an icon code. The mapping is described here. For example, a code “10d” would link to this icon.
* Your React app should call this API upon load or when the button is clicked, be well organized (.jsx, .css, .scss files etc.), and be able to run locally with minimal effort (usually via an “npm build” command defined in a package.json file).
